### Hi there, I'm Ray ðŸ‘‹
(he/him)

I'm an Electrical Engineering student at Virginia Tech with a passion for avionics. I'm currently working on developing my programming skills so I'm trying out the world of Hackathons. I'm familiar with C, C++, and Python programming languages but I'm always looking to learn more about these languages and more! Feel free to reach out to me with questions, to talk about current aerospace news, or anything you can think of at my email: rayding7@vt.edu or LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/raymondd-vtech/
Fun Fact: Minoring in Psychology!
